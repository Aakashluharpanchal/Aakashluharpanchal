 # Aakash Luharpanchal (Robotics & Multi-Sensor Fusion Engineer)

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a Mechanical Design and Robotics Engineer with an M.Sc. in Robotics and over 5 years of experience in product design, CAD modeling, and automation systems. I specialize in designing electro-mechanical products, optimizing manufacturing workflows, and developing autonomous robotic systems using ROS2, C++, and sensor fusion.

 ## About Me
I am passionate about developing cutting-edge solutions in mechanical design and autonomous robotics, with expertise in the full product development lifecycleâ€”from concept generation to prototyping, testing, and final production. Some of my recent contributions include:

* Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) development for autonomous pallet handling in warehouses using ROS2-based control and multi-sensor fusion (radar, ultrasonic, IMU).
* Leading the design and simulation of a multi-arm robotic assembly system in Gazebo and RViz, optimizing kinematics and control for precise operations.
* Designing electro-mechanical systems such as relay-operated switches and proximity-sensor-based automation components that improved production efficiency by up to 41%.
With 5+ years of experience in CAD modeling (Fusion 360, SolidWorks, AutoCAD), I have developed robust metal and plastic components and implemented lean manufacturing processes to reduce assembly complexity.

## Key Engineering Focus Areas

* Mechanical Design & CAD: Proficient in Fusion 360, SolidWorks, AutoCAD, and Inventor for 3D modeling, assemblies, and technical drawings.
* Electro-Mechanical Product Design: Experience in designing metal housings, sensor mounts, sheet metal parts, and automated systems.
* Robotics and Sensor Fusion: Skilled in SLAM, state estimation, path planning, and multi-sensor data integration using C++, ROS/ROS2, and Gazebo.
* Control Systems: Knowledge of PID control, adaptive control, and kinematics for robotics and automation.
* Manufacturing: Experience with metal fabrication, casting, and lean production workflows.
