 # Aakash Luharpanchal (Robotics & Multi-Sensor Fusion Engineer)

Welcome to my GitHub! I am a passionate engineer with an M.Sc. in Robotics and a keen interest in Localization, Mapping, and Robotic Systems. Over the years, I have contributed to projects spanning ROS-based control systems, sensor fusion, and UGV development. I love applying mathematical models and algorithms to solve real-world challenges in autonomous navigation.

 ## About Me
During my time at Cranfield University, I led projects involving multi-arm robotic systems for in-orbit assembly and human-robot interaction, where I utilized smart wearables to capture physiological data and assess stress and comfort dynamics. I am also developing UGV for autonomous warehouse pallet handling featuring ROS2-based control, IMU calibration, and radar integration for enhanced localization and obstacle avoidance.

I am enthusiastic about sensor fusion and SLAM using IMU, LiDAR, and computer vision. I thrive in projects that require designing robust control systems and achieving high-performance robotic autonomy through ROS2, Gazebo, C++, and Linux.

## Key Engineering Focus Areas

Navigation: SLAM, VIO (Visual-Inertial Odometry), Path Planning, Autonomous Navigation

Control Systems: PID, Adaptive Control, Kinematics, and System Calibration

Optimization: EKF (Extended Kalman Filters), Heuristic Algorithms (GA, PSO, etc.)

Computer Vision: Object Detection, OpenCV, 3D Scene Reconstruction

Machine Learning: Classical (KNN, SVM), Deep Learning (CNN, RNN)

## Programming & Software Skills
