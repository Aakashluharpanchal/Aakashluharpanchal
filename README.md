 # Aakash Luharpanchal (Robotics & Multi-Sensor Fusion Engineer)

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a Mechanical Design and Robotics Engineer with an M.Sc. in Robotics and over 5 years of experience in product design, CAD modeling, and automation systems. I specialize in designing electro-mechanical products, optimizing manufacturing workflows, and developing autonomous robotic systems using ROS2, C++, and sensor fusion.

 ## About Me
During my time at Cranfield University, I led and contributed to complex projects such as:

* Multi-Arm Robotic Systems for In-Orbit Assembly: Developed and simulated robotic systems using ROS and Gazebo in collaboration with aerospace partners.
* Human-Robot Interaction Study: Leveraged wearable technology to capture physiological data and analyze human stress and comfort in robotic collaboration environments.
  
Currently, I am developing an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) for autonomous warehouse pallet handling, featuring:

ROS2-based control architecture
IMU calibration and radar integration for enhanced localization and obstacle avoidance.
With 5+ years of CAD design experience, I have a proven track record of creating robust and innovative mechanical systems using tools like Fusion 360 and SolidWorks.

My core expertise lies in sensor fusion, SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), and designing control systems for high-performance robotic autonomy.

## Key Engineering Focus Areas

* Navigation: SLAM, VIO (Visual-Inertial Odometry), Path Planning, Autonomous Navigation
* Control Systems: PID, Adaptive Control, Kinematics, and System Calibration
* Optimization: EKF (Extended Kalman Filters), Heuristic Algorithms (GA, PSO, etc.)
* Computer Vision: Object Detection, OpenCV, 3D Scene Reconstruction
* Machine Learning: Classical (KNN, SVM), Deep Learning (CNN, RNN)
